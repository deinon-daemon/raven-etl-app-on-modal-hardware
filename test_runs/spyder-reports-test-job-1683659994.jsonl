The buns they created range from sweet to savory and classic to contemporary \u2014 but they\u2019re all equally irresistible. Steamed Buns Use a single base dough recipe, created for us by Joy Huang, to make four distinct types of steamed buns, including ones filled with juicy steamed pork; umami-rich, mushroom-stuffed buns; buns loaded with gingery custard; and buns that only look like tiny toadstools \u2014 but are filled with molten dark chocolate. (Need a primer on how to steam these? Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide.) Mushroom and Cabbage Pan-Fried Buns (Sheng Jian Bao) Hetty McKinnon\u2019s savory, umami-rich vegetarian buns are first pan-fried until golden and crisp, then steamed until tender. Steamed Pork Buns (Xian Rou Bao) Betty Liu\u2019s Chinese pork buns are gingery and juicy. A typical Shanghainese breakfast, they are good any (and every) time of day.Get the recipe Chocolate  Mushroom  Buns These adorable buns, created by Clarissa Wei, aren\u2019t filled with fungi \u2014 they just resemble them. Instead, they\u2019re stuffed with dark chocolate, which melts when the buns are steamed.Get the recipe Steamed Carrot Buns with Fresh Ginger Custard Frankie Gaw adds carrot juice to his dough, giving it a warm hue; the buns are split and filled with a vibrant fresh ginger custard. Baked Buns This collection of tender, fluffy baked bun recipes uses our incredibly versatile Japanese Milk Bread dough as its base. Slightly sweet and incredibly plush, the dough is the perfect foil for buns filled with vanilla custard, black sesame, and, yes, even hot dogs. Pineapple Buns (Bolo Bao) A Chinese bakery classic, these cookie-crowned buns resemble the fruit after which they\u2019re named. In Tatiana Bautista\u2019s version, the pastry cream filling is optional (but very highly encouraged). Scallion Sesame Hot Dog Buns Hot dogs swaddled in sweet scallion scented dough? Fans of pigs in a blanket, take note: Betty Liu\u2019s recipe is just as good as it sounds.Get the recipe Black Sesame and Coconut Buns An earthy combination of nutty black sesame and coconut fills these feathery buns created by Hetty McKinnon.Get the recipe Meet the Bakers Betty Liu @bliu07 Food writer and doctor-in-training Betty Liu is the author of My Shanghai: Recipes and Stories From a City on the Water.

Our History Founded in 1790. Still going strong today. Discover our years of baking history, stretching back to the earliest days of America. Our historyTwo centuries of baking joy. King Arthur Baking Company has a long and storied history, stretching back nearly to the American Revolution. We ve been providing bakers with superior flour since 1790: from Martha Washington s apple pie through the invention of the chocolate chip cookie, from flour in wooden barrels to bags at the supermarket, we ve been there. Simply put, King Arthur and American baking have been close companions since the very beginning. 1790 America s First Flour Company Is Founded There were 13 states in the new United States. George Washington was America s first president. And Henry Wood began importing flour from England, establishing his business at Boston s Long Wharf. Henry Wood &amp; Company, the original ancestor of King Arthur Baking Company, was the first flour company in the young United States \u2014 and first food company in New England. Pre-1800 First Apple Pie Appears  As American as apple pie  \u2014 but when did the original recipe for this iconic pie appear? In Martha Washington s Booke of Cookery, handwritten by the first president s wife during the latter part of the 18th century. 1820s We Begin Milling Flour From American-Grown Wheat We begin milling flour from American-grown wheat. As American farmers moved west, wheat farming flourished. A more bountiful wheat supply, along with the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825, made it possible for Henry Wood &amp; Company to stop its English wheat imports and begin selling American-milled flour. 1849 San Francisco Sourdough: Feeding The Miners Gold was discovered in northern California in 1848, and the rush was on. Hungry miners developed naturally fermented  sourdough  as a way to bake bread. And in 1849, The French Bakery became the first shop in San Francisco offering sourdough bread for sale. 1886 Pecan Pie Makes Its Debut Pecan pie became a stalwart of Southern baking in the twentieth century. But its first actual appearance was in Harper s Bazaar magazine, which published a rudimentary recipe in 1886. 1896 Our Flour Gets A Name: King Arthur The Sands, Taylor, &amp; Wood Company introduced its  new and improved  flour at the Boston Food Fair, naming it King Arthur for its Arthurian attributes:  purity, loyalty, honesty, superior strength, and a dedication to a higher purpose.  1905 New York City s First Pizzeria Opens Pizza was brought to America in the late 19th century, courtesy of a wave of Italian immigrants. But it wasn t considered  takeout  until 1905, when Gennaro Lombardi began selling pizza out of his New York City grocery store \u2014 thus establishing America s first pizzeria. 1930 Banana Bread Starts Its Rise To Popularity That most ubiquitous of quick breads, banana bread, first appeared on the American scene in 1930 not to showcase bananas \u2014 but thanks to the increasing availability of commercial baking powder and baking soda. 1933 The Chocolate Chip Cookie Is Born A landmark moment in cookie history took place in 1933 when Ruth Wakefield, owner of the Toll House Inn in Whitman, Massachusetts, added chopped chocolate to her sugar cookie recipe in an attempt to create a chocolate cookie. The chocolate didn t melt... and the chocolate chip cookie was born. 1960s King Arthur Expands After a mid-century expansion, by 1968 King Arthur had become New England s largest bakery supply distributor, offering virtually every ingredient used by professional bakers, from pie fillings to flavorings to ice cream toppings. In the late 1970s, the business decided to return to its original mission: selling flour to home and professional bakers. 1973 Zucchini Bread Invades American Kitchens The back-to-the-land movement of the 1960s extended into the 1970s, with people embracing  grow your own  and healthier natural foods. One of the first and most popular recipes for zucchini bread appeared in Beard on Bread in 1973. 1984 Boston To Vermont: King Arthur Establishes A New Home After nearly 200 years headquartered in Boston, King Arthur moved north to Norwich, Vermont. Over the next 10 years, the company grew quickly, and in 1995 launched an ambitious building project destined to become today s flagship campus. 1990 The Baker s Catalogue Is Launched With the demand for King Arthur flour growing beyond New England, the company launched The Baker s Catalogue. Mailed to 10,000 customers, the small, black-and-white catalogue included baking tools, bowls \u2014 and flour, of course. 1991 Chocolate Lava Cake Explodes Chocolate took prime place on restaurant dessert menus during the 1980s, with soft-center chocolate souffl\u00e9 cakes appearing regularly. In 1991, the chocolate lava cake \u2014 chocolate cake with a truly liquid center \u2014 erupted at various New York City restaurants. 1992 We Begin Our Middle School Outreach Program In 1992, King Arthur s Life Skills Bread Baking program taught 900 Connecticut schoolchildren to bake bread and share it with those less fortunate. Today, our Bake for Good program has expanded nationwide, and has reached hundreds of thousands of middle school kids. 1996 King Arthur Goes Online Christmas Day 1996 marked the launch of the company s first website, showcasing 13 recipes, an invitation to  sign our guest book,  and information on our four different flours. Today, the site features more than 2,000 recipes, 1,500+ blog posts, and 1,000 baking products. 2000 Our Bakery And Baking School Open Their Doors A long-time dream of King Arthur co-owner Brinna Sands was for the business to open an onsite bakery and school. After years of research and planning, Brinna s dream came true: The King Arthur Flour Bakery and Baking Education Center opened their doors on our Norwich, Vermont campus. 2004 King Arthur Becomes Employee-Owned In 1996, owners Frank and Brinna Sands, in order to ensure King Arthur would remain in good and caring hands after their retirement, decided to sell the company to its employees. The sale was completed in 2004. 2007 King Arthur Joins B Corp as a Founding Member Carrying on a long-time business commitment to do the right thing, King Arthur proudly became a founding B Corp member, changing its bylaws to reflect its commitment to all stakeholders: shareholders, business partners, the community, and the environment. 2020 King Arthur introduces the wheat crown After 230 years of baking, we decided it was time to change our company\u2019s name and logo to better represent who we have become and the things we believe in. The wheat crown represents our heritage, our quality, and our commitment to agriculture.

As we navigate in these uncertain times, our north star remains our vision to inspire and share the joy of baking, building stronger and healthier communities. Community is a word you hear a lot. It speaks to connections, to support, to togetherness. There cannot be a more important time than now to be coming together to do all that we can to help one another, our families, our neighbors, and our communities. As always, we start and end with doing all that we can to ensure the safety and well-being of our customers and our fellow employee-owners. As an essential food business, we remain open and follow closely the recommended practices provided by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to ensure the highest level of protection to all of our employee-owners, especially those who cannot work from home. Amidst this crisis requiring us to stay home as much as possible, baking has become a bit of national pastime \u2013 for people who have never picked up a whisk to those who have made it their life\u2019s work. We certainly believe baking brings people together, brings joy, and can simply be a great source of comfort at any time, but more than ever in these incredibly challenging times. So we hope you\u2019re able to enjoy a freshly baked loaf of bread or the pure delight of a warm chocolate chip cookie. Stay hopeful. Remain resolute. Together, we\u2019ll move through this. Please continue to follow CDC guidelines for remaining safe and healthy. Below you will find important information about the critical ways we are working to address this crisis. Karen Colberg &amp; Ralph Carlton Co-CEOs, King Arthur Baking Company - Safety and Wellness Measures - Safety is our priority: your safety as well as that of our employee-owners. We\u2019ve built a strong network of protections around our team members, beginning with the best safeguard available \u2014 social distancing. This has taken the form of many of our team working from home and includes the rapid mobilization of new resources to make off-site work possible for many who would have previously been unequipped to do so. For those whose roles simply can\u2019t be translated away from our facilities, such as production and fulfillment, we\u2019ve rearranged work spaces and schedules to promote person-to-person distance. In addition to this, we\u2019ve enhanced our already robust cleanliness processes by: - Increasing sanitization frequency for our buildings and equipment - Providing more hand sanitizer stations in active areas - Reinforcing education on thorough hand washing and personal hygiene techniques - Wearing of cloth masks within our facilities and rubber gloves during product handling - Monitoring movement within our buildings to both prevent illness and enable us to take precise action should anyone become ill despite every precaution being taken We also recognize that there\u2019s more to protecting our team than just physical proximity and cleanliness. During this time of nationwide instability, security for one\u2019s livelihood is paramount. Our Leadership and Human Resources teams have assembled a portfolio of benefits and policies to help protect the jobs and income of King Arthur employee-owners. These solutions include: - Significantly extending the length of guaranteed paid time off - Extending new time off benefits to cover caring for dependents facing health or schedule disruptions, including children whose schools have closed or other reliant family - Cross-training those ready to work, but whose normal roles are paused, so that they can assist areas of our company facing greater levels of demand - Increasing access to telehealth resources for both physical and mental health Guidance from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and state health authorities have been, and will continue to be, our team\u2019s primary sources for information on safety and best practices as we face the challenges posed by Covid-19. We\u2019ll continue to use these recommendations as the framework of our decision making to ensure safety remains the priority in all our efforts. - Supporting our Community - For us, baking has always been about strengthening the bonds of community. There\u2019s no more fundamental example of people coming together than the timeless mainstay of a group circling around a warm fire, passing food from one to the other. In difficult times like these, our greatest supports are the people around us who care for each other and extend a hand when others need it most. In this effort, we\u2019ve launched a new aid program called For Goodness Bakes, a lighthearted name for an important initiative to keep bakeries running during financially challenging times. To do this, we\u2019re directing tens of thousands of dollars to directly purchase bread and other baked goods from King Arthur bakery customers, which they then distribute to areas of need within their local communities \u2014 food pantries, organizations that support unemployed food service workers, homeless populations, and more. Our employee-owners have also leapt to the task of addressing other needs in our own local community around Norwich, VT: - A sewing collective among us have put needle and thread to the task of making hundreds of cloth masks for health care workers, our own team members who continue to safely perform essential roles at our own facilities, and others in need - Putting our Caf\u00e9 Sous Chef on an extended volunteer assignment to manage daily takeout meals, organize food deliveries, and coordinate food drops for our local food shelf program - Donating thousands of fresh-baked breads and other baked goods to local food shelves and shelters We\u2019ve also directed more time and energy towards developing free educational resources in our social media channels. From our approachable and uplifting father + son baking series Martin Bakes at Home, to our instructional kid-focused Bake for Good videos, to our weekly Facebook Live Isolation Baking Show with accomplished bakers Jeffrey Hamelman and Gesine Bullock-Prado, along with running Q&amp;As, publishing new recipes, and increasing our blog posting frequency, we seek to provide for an especially urgent combination of needs: no-cost, quality baking education and recipes, and places where people can feed their yearning for community in a setting that\u2019s friendly, uplifting, and supportive. If you\u2019re on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter, we invite you to join in our community by asking questions and showing us what you\u2019re baking by tagging @kingarthurflour and using #bakewithus - Product Availability on our Website - You\u2019ve probably witnessed empty flour shelves at your grocery store and backordered items on our website. Demand for these products has sharply multiplied in past weeks, outpacing the speed at which new products can be created and delivered even as our mills run at full capacity and we\u2019ve added another mill to the King Arthur family. We\u2019re working closely with our mills and partners to support rapid production schedules within an environment of safety. We will continually evaluate all resources available to us and creatively pursue additional solutions as we seek to provide the best service possible while overcoming the challenges posed by Covid-19. - Order Shipping Times - Due to unprecedented levels of ordering through our website, maxed capacity among national carriers (including our shipper, FedEx), and more caution applied to all procedures in response to Covid-19, customers should be prepared for delays in receiving their orders. We\u2019ve temporarily introduced the following measures to help your order ship as quickly as possible:s - Suspended shipments to Canada and other international locations - Secured the services of an extra fulfillment partner to pack and ship orders - Added shifts in our warehouse to the extent that we\u2019re able to do so safely Know that our team is working diligently to provide you with the best experience we possibly can under the exceptional conditions we all find ourselves in. You can rely on us to continue finding creative solutions to challenging problems like these while prioritizing health and well-being. - Product Availability in Grocery Stores - By now, you\u2019ve probably witnessed empty flour shelves at your grocery store and backordered items on our website. Demand for these products has sharply multiplied in past weeks, outpacing the speed at which new product can be created and delivered even as our mills run at full capacity. In some cases, getting more product onto shelves has been delayed within stores themselves as many struggle with fewer staff, reduced hours, and other challenges related to Covid-19. Our supply chain and logistics team is actively working with stores and distributors across the country to get our flour back on the shelves of grocery stores and national retailers. To help address these challenges: - Our mills have extended their working hours by introducing additional shifts - We\u2019ve welcomed a new partner mill to the King Arthur production family - We\u2019ve shifted parts of our distribution network from rail to truck, quickening transit time You can rely on our team to continually evaluate all resources available to us and pursue additional solutions as we seek to provide the best service possible while overcoming the challenges posed by Covid-19. - Baking School and our Norwich Store &amp; Caf\u00e9 - In support of the health and well-being of our customers, community, and our team of employee-owners, we have made some adjustments at our Baking School and Caf\u00e9 &amp; Store. Find the most up-to-date information here. We thank you for your understanding and for working with us to pursue a safe, healthy environment for all. We plan to reintroduce normal operations and programs once we\u2019re confident this time of heightened risk has passed.

Cherry Pie Cupcakes These adorable cupcakes feature vanilla cake, cherry filling, and piped brown sugar frosting that mimics a pie\u2019s lattice top.

Lemon Meringue Cupcakes Buttermilk cake, tart lemon curd filling, and a swirl of meringue on top make these cupcakes as good as the pie that inspired them.

From us, the employee-owners, to our relationships with others, to our flours, our recipes, and the sourcing of all our products, we seek the highest standards in everything we are, and in everything we do.

Community We believe baking helps to build strong and vibrant connections.

We strive to serve, educate, and inspire those around us, meeting each individual where they are in their baking journey. Employee Ownership We believe in employee ownership.

A Letter From Our Co-CEOs, Our purpose at King Arthur Baking is to inspire and share the joy of baking, building stronger and healthier communities with each bake. We remain committed to this purpose and the work continues to run deeper. As we take time to reflect, we feel proud of the meaningful work we have done and the positive impact we ve made, and excited about the greater, more intentional impacts to come. In 2021, we continued to prioritize the well-being of our communities, starting with the health and safety of our employee-owners. We also continued to support our bakery partners and their communities across the country through our For Goodness Bakes program. And as we have since 1996, we partnered with schools across the country through our Bake for Good program, bringing the joy and comfort of baking to children even as they learned remotely from home. We used our voice and resources to give representation and support to more marginalized communities in the world of baking. We partnered with organizations doing essential work to create food justice for BIPOC communities. We also expanded our network of content contributors to feature a broader range of voices, perspectives, backgrounds, and areas of expertise, prioritizing those historically excluded from the food media landscape. Justice, especially food and racial justice, will continue to be an essential pillar of our giving. We pushed forward on our commitment to greater corporate sustainability, completing a year-long sustainability assessment, evaluating the lifecycle of our products from farm to kitchen. This assessment became the framework of our 2030 sustainability goals, focused on social, environmental, and economic stewardship. While these goals won t be announced until 2022, sustainability and DEI is now embedded in our organization and work is underway. We believe that baking can make the world a better place \u2014 all while enjoying delicious treats along the way. Read on to learn more about the work we re doing to make this happen. Sincerely, Karen Colberg &amp; Ralph Carlton PEOPLE Employee Ownership King Arthur Baking is 100% employee-owned! Each person working here has a real stake in the company s success. - 100% Employee-Owned - 363 Employee Owners - Best for the World for Workers B Corp for 2021 Compensation We believe in paying a fair and competitive wage and sharing the company\u2019s success with each person. In 2019, we increased our entry wage to $15.00/hour: more than 37% greater than the minimum wage in our county. Profit sharing is paid out to all eligible employee-owners when the company achieves its financial targets. Wellness We are committed to fostering a culture of wellness and healthy lifestyles throughout the organization. - $500 in wellness incentives per employee - Tiered subsidy in local farm s CSA program - 4 hours of paid time off per year to vote Culture of Belonging We believe our culture is paramount to all that we do. In 2021, nurturing and evolving that culture became more important than ever. We worked to ensure King Arthur provides a workplace environment that prioritizes respect, inclusivity, and equal opportunity, and which better reflects the wonderful diversity of our baking community. - Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion team comprised of 14 employee-owners - 98% participation in cultural proficiency and social justice trainings - Transformation of hiring practices to recruit for culture add rather than culture fit - Named to Best Places to Work in Vermont since 2006 Volunteer Time All employee-owners receive 40 hours of paid volunteer time per year. |FY17||FY18||FY19||FY20||FY21| |Employees Participating||293||270||300||302||251| |Hours||5,635||5,151||6,126||6,116||3,452| 69% of employees volunteering in the community. * Volunteering decreased due to COVID COMMUNITY Giving 2021 |2017||2018||2019||2020||2021| |$313k||$325k||$316k||$778k||$711k| |-16%||+4%||-3%||146%||-9%| Our giving back philosophy is a cornerstone of our mission to use our business as a force for good and to build stronger and healthier communities. For Goodness Bakes We launched For Goodness Bakes, an initiative to help bakeries across the country during financially challenging times. We directed tens of thousands of dollars to purchase bread and baked goods from bakeries, which they then distributed to areas of need within their local communities. Equitable Access to Real Food Creating a more just food system is integral to realizing an inclusive, equitable future for all people. In 2021 we donated flour to 55 foodbanks in 34 states and were named a Feeding America Guiding Partner. Building Community Through Baking We run a national Bake for Good program: a free, STEM-based program that teaches kids how to bake bread and encourages them to donate a loaf. This program went virtual in 2021, providing a bright spot for many students and teachers during remote learning. Local Giving We have the privilege to help raise up our local communities through the support of partners such as Willing Hands, a food recovery organization which serves 30,000 individuals annually while mitigating 1 million pounds of CO2 emissions from food waste. Regenerative Food Systems We support efforts that positively impact our natural environment, conserve resources, and develop renewable energy sources, such as Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont s Resilience Grants for the BIPOC farming community. Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion We Are Taking A Stand At the beginning of the year, we created a fund to support organizations that address the inequities in our food systems and help our most marginalized communities gain equal access to food. We spent time listening and learning to understand how we can become better, more effective partners. We partnered with 18 organizations serving BIPOC communities to: - Increase access to farmland and agricultural resources - Break down barriers to food entrepreneurship - Increase access to healthy food This is only the beginning of our work to enhance equity and food justice. We will use our voice and uplift the voices of others to celebrate the diversity in baking. We will continue to work collectively with partner organizations, content contributors, consumers, and our fellow employee-owners to learn together and foster change. PLANET From farms to kitchens, we are on a mission to use the power of baking to restore nature and build a more equitable world. In 2021, we conducted a year-long sustainability assessment to evaluate the lifecycle of our products from farm to kitchen and identify our 2030 sustainability goals (to be announced in 2022). Sustainability Our definition of sustainability is holistic. King Arthur Baking nurtures people and the planet with: - An approach to business that balances purpose and profit - Protection and regeneration of natural resources - Responsible sourcing of ingredients and products - Greater equity for all people and communities Circular Packaging - 100% recyclable flour bags - SFI certified (mill partners) - Incorporating PCR into pack Renewable Energy - 500kW solar array in Norwich, VT that offsets over 50% of our total electricity use - Two EV Charging Stations at retail location - Purchased electricity 100% carbon free and 68% renewable Our emissions are dominated by the wheat supply chain (growing, milling, and transportation), not our headquarter offices and operations. And we take responsibility for all of it. Total Estimated Emissions Usage |Wheat &amp; Milling||59.1%| |Transportation||20.0%| |Packaging Life Cycle||3.0%| |Other Flours &amp; Ingredients||5.1%| |Use Phase - Product||12.5%| |HQ/Retail/Offices||0.4%| Regenerative Agriculture This work begins in the field, partnering with farmers to learn and encourage environmentally and socially responsible practices. We are working with mills and farmers to progress on the regenerative agriculture journey. In early 2021, we partnered with Ardent Mills, one of our long-time trusted milling partners, on a regenerative agriculture program to strengthen the soil ecosystem and help producers improve their farms  productivity and profitability. We are also actively seeing and engaging with other mill partners and farmers. $150k+ donated to nonprofits in fiscal year 2021 $981,245 amount donated since 2014 MEASURING PROGRESS B Impact Assessment: King Arthur Baking has been evaluating our social and environmental performance since 2007. |Summary||FY21 KAB Score||Median Score*||Change vs. FY20| |Governance||18.2||7.3||+0.2| |Workers||61||31.1||+0.2| |Community||18.6||13.5||-0.8| |Environment||24.2||16||+1.7| |Customers||3.2||1.9||-0.1| |Overall B Score||125.4||84.1||+1.2| * of all business that have completed the B Impact Assessment in the U.S. LOOKING AHEAD In FY2022, we aim to nurture Culture &amp; Community through the following goals: - Focus on DEI, specifically around equitable access and building a culture of belonging - Introduce new hybrid work model supported by new facilities plan - Develop talent to support future growth - Build and begin implementation of our sustainability strategy, including multiple regenerative agriculture initiatives As a Benefit Corporation, our directors and officers upheld and acted in accordance with Vermont standards.

Once you have it, all that\u2019s left to do is to throw on some toppings, turn your oven to pizza mode (much easier than it sounds), and repeat the process a week later. Or sooner! After all, there\u2019s no wrong time to make pizza. The only way to go wrong is when you don\u2019t make pizza often enough. Pizza night in 4 steps Find your pizza The most important step in designing pizza night is picking the pie. It has to be the crust you crave (blistered Neapolitan? Thick, soft Detroit-style?), but it also has to fit your schedule. Some doughs require overnight rises, while others barely need to rise at all. Which recipe works for you depends on if you\u2019re the type of person who wants to mix a dough the night before, in the morning \u2014 or an hour before you want to eat. The Mood: Traditional and ready in 24 hours The Pick: Neapolitan-Style Pizzaget the recipe The Mood: Gluten-free in about an hour The Pick: Gluten-Free PizzaGet the recipe The Mood: Pan pizza you can plan ahead for The Pick: Crispy Cheesy Pan Pizzaget the recipe The Mood: Crispy, crackery, and fast The Pick: Thin-Crust PizzaGet the recipe The Mood: Thick, soft, and same-day The Pick: Detroit-Style Pizzaget the recipe The Mood: Delivery-style (and almost as quick) The Pick: The Easiest Pizza You ll Ever MakeGet the recipe Step Two Pick your toppings Tomato sauce and mozzarella are the obvious choices, and they re the defaults for a reason. But when you do pizza night every week, it pays to have options to rotate in and out: muenster instead of mozz, romesco in place of tomato. Make your oven a pizza oven The average home oven tops out at 550\u02daF \u2014 a far cry from the 900\u02daF ovens that Neapolitan pies are traditionally baked in. But fabulous pizza can nevertheless be made in a home oven. All it takes is a hot broiler, a few pieces of equipment \u2014 and maybe a quick physics lesson. Wait, you have an Ooni? That\u2019s a different story. Ooni tabletop pizza ovens can get as hot as 900\u02daF, turning out pizzas in 90 seconds. But according to King Arthur baker Martin Philip, you may want to actually turn them down to 750\u02daF. That\u2019s just one of a plethora of tips Martin has for mastering these machines. Pizza Stone You can make your pizza on a sheet pan, but switching to a pizza stone is a major upgrade in terms of thermal mass. Leave the stone in the oven while it preheats and it ll do wonders to give your pizza a crisp bottom crust. Pizza Steel Like a pizza stone, but even better: Being a metal, steel is far more conductive than ceramic, which means that not only do steels hold heat well, but they also transfer it to the pizza more quickly than stones. Ooni Koda Pizza Oven This incredible portable oven can heat up to 900\u00b0F and cook a pizza in 90 seconds. But that s just the beginning. Once you get a handle on it, you ll use the Ooni to bake fish, make tortillas, and roast fruit for dessert.

The buns they created range from sweet to savory and classic to contemporary \u2014 but they\u2019re all equally irresistible. Steamed Buns Use a single base dough recipe, created for us by Joy Huang, to make four distinct types of steamed buns, including ones filled with juicy steamed pork; umami-rich, mushroom-stuffed buns; buns loaded with gingery custard; and buns that only look like tiny toadstools \u2014 but are filled with molten dark chocolate. (Need a primer on how to steam these? Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide.) Mushroom and Cabbage Pan-Fried Buns (Sheng Jian Bao) Hetty McKinnon\u2019s savory, umami-rich vegetarian buns are first pan-fried until golden and crisp, then steamed until tender. Steamed Pork Buns (Xian Rou Bao) Betty Liu\u2019s Chinese pork buns are gingery and juicy. A typical Shanghainese breakfast, they are good any (and every) time of day.Get the recipe Chocolate  Mushroom  Buns These adorable buns, created by Clarissa Wei, aren\u2019t filled with fungi \u2014 they just resemble them. Instead, they\u2019re stuffed with dark chocolate, which melts when the buns are steamed.Get the recipe Steamed Carrot Buns with Fresh Ginger Custard Frankie Gaw adds carrot juice to his dough, giving it a warm hue; the buns are split and filled with a vibrant fresh ginger custard. Baked Buns This collection of tender, fluffy baked bun recipes uses our incredibly versatile Japanese Milk Bread dough as its base. Slightly sweet and incredibly plush, the dough is the perfect foil for buns filled with vanilla custard, black sesame, and, yes, even hot dogs. Pineapple Buns (Bolo Bao) A Chinese bakery classic, these cookie-crowned buns resemble the fruit after which they\u2019re named. In Tatiana Bautista\u2019s version, the pastry cream filling is optional (but very highly encouraged). Scallion Sesame Hot Dog Buns Hot dogs swaddled in sweet scallion scented dough?

Our History Founded in 1790. Still going strong today. Discover our years of baking history, stretching back to the earliest days of America. Our historyTwo centuries of baking joy. King Arthur Baking Company has a long and storied history, stretching back nearly to the American Revolution. We ve been providing bakers with superior flour since 1790: from Martha Washington s apple pie through the invention of the chocolate chip cookie, from flour in wooden barrels to bags at the supermarket, we ve been there. Simply put, King Arthur and American baking have been close companions since the very beginning. 1790 America s First Flour Company Is Founded There were 13 states in the new United States. George Washington was America s first president. And Henry Wood began importing flour from England, establishing his business at Boston s Long Wharf. Henry Wood &amp; Company, the original ancestor of King Arthur Baking Company, was the first flour company in the young United States \u2014 and first food company in New England. Pre-1800 First Apple Pie Appears  As American as apple pie  \u2014 but when did the original recipe for this iconic pie appear? In Martha Washington s Booke of Cookery, handwritten by the first president s wife during the latter part of the 18th century. 1820s We Begin Milling Flour From American-Grown Wheat We begin milling flour from American-grown wheat. As American farmers moved west, wheat farming flourished. A more bountiful wheat supply, along with the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825, made it possible for Henry Wood &amp; Company to stop its English wheat imports and begin selling American-milled flour. 1849 San Francisco Sourdough: Feeding The Miners Gold was discovered in northern California in 1848, and the rush was on. Hungry miners developed naturally fermented  sourdough  as a way to bake bread. And in 1849, The French Bakery became the first shop in San Francisco offering sourdough bread for sale. 1886 Pecan Pie Makes Its Debut Pecan pie became a stalwart of Southern baking in the twentieth century. But its first actual appearance was in Harper s Bazaar magazine, which published a rudimentary recipe in 1886. 1896 Our Flour Gets A Name: King Arthur The Sands, Taylor, &amp; Wood Company introduced its  new and improved  flour at the Boston Food Fair, naming it King Arthur for its Arthurian attributes:  purity, loyalty, honesty, superior strength, and a dedication to a higher purpose.  1905 New York City s First Pizzeria Opens Pizza was brought to America in the late 19th century, courtesy of a wave of Italian immigrants. But it wasn t considered  takeout  until 1905, when Gennaro Lombardi began selling pizza out of his New York City grocery store \u2014 thus establishing America s first pizzeria. 1930 Banana Bread Starts Its Rise To Popularity That most ubiquitous of quick breads, banana bread, first appeared on the American scene in 1930 not to showcase bananas \u2014 but thanks to the increasing availability of commercial baking powder and baking soda. 1933 The Chocolate Chip Cookie Is Born A landmark moment in cookie history took place in 1933 when Ruth Wakefield, owner of the Toll House Inn in Whitman, Massachusetts, added chopped chocolate to her sugar cookie recipe in an attempt to create a chocolate cookie. The chocolate didn t melt... and the chocolate chip cookie was born. 1960s King Arthur Expands After a mid-century expansion, by 1968 King Arthur had become New England s largest bakery supply distributor, offering virtually every ingredient used by professional bakers, from pie fillings to flavorings to ice cream toppings. In the late 1970s, the business decided to return to its original mission: selling flour to home and professional bakers. 1973 Zucchini Bread Invades American Kitchens The back-to-the-land movement of the 1960s extended into the 1970s, with people embracing  grow your own  and healthier natural foods. One of the first and most popular recipes for zucchini bread appeared in Beard on Bread in 1973. 1984 Boston To Vermont: King Arthur Establishes A New Home After nearly 200 years headquartered in Boston, King Arthur moved north to Norwich, Vermont. Over the next 10 years, the company grew quickly, and in 1995 launched an ambitious building project destined to become today s flagship campus. 1990 The Baker s Catalogue Is Launched With the demand for King Arthur flour growing beyond New England, the company launched The Baker s Catalogue. Mailed to 10,000 customers, the small, black-and-white catalogue included baking tools, bowls \u2014 and flour, of course. 1991 Chocolate Lava Cake Explodes Chocolate took prime place on restaurant dessert menus during the 1980s, with soft-center chocolate souffl\u00e9 cakes appearing regularly. In 1991, the chocolate lava cake \u2014 chocolate cake with a truly liquid center \u2014 erupted at various New York City restaurants. 1992 We Begin Our Middle School Outreach Program In 1992, King Arthur s Life Skills Bread Baking program taught 900 Connecticut schoolchildren to bake bread and share it with those less fortunate. Today, our Bake for Good program has expanded nationwide, and has reached hundreds of thousands of middle school kids. 1996 King Arthur Goes Online Christmas Day 1996 marked the launch of the company s first website, showcasing 13 recipes, an invitation to  sign our guest book,  and information on our four different flours. Today, the site features more than 2,000 recipes, 1,500+ blog posts, and 1,000 baking products. 2000 Our Bakery And Baking School Open Their Doors A long-time dream of King Arthur co-owner Brinna Sands was for the business to open an onsite bakery and school. After years of research and planning, Brinna s dream came true: The King Arthur Flour Bakery and Baking Education Center opened their doors on our Norwich, Vermont campus. 2004 King Arthur Becomes Employee-Owned In 1996, owners Frank and Brinna Sands, in order to ensure King Arthur would remain in good and caring hands after their retirement, decided to sell the company to its employees. The sale was completed in 2004. 2007 King Arthur Joins B Corp as a Founding Member Carrying on a long-time business commitment to do the right thing, King Arthur proudly became a founding B Corp member, changing its bylaws to reflect its commitment to all stakeholders: shareholders, business partners, the community, and the environment. 2020 King Arthur introduces the wheat crown After 230 years of baking, we decided it was time to change our company\u2019s name and logo to better represent who we have become and the things we believe in. The wheat crown represents our heritage, our quality, and our commitment to agriculture.

As we navigate in these uncertain times, our north star remains our vision to inspire and share the joy of baking, building stronger and healthier communities. Community is a word you hear a lot. It speaks to connections, to support, to togetherness. There cannot be a more important time than now to be coming together to do all that we can to help one another, our families, our neighbors, and our communities. As always, we start and end with doing all that we can to ensure the safety and well-being of our customers and our fellow employee-owners. As an essential food business, we remain open and follow closely the recommended practices provided by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to ensure the highest level of protection to all of our employee-owners, especially those who cannot work from home. Amidst this crisis requiring us to stay home as much as possible, baking has become a bit of national pastime \u2013 for people who have never picked up a whisk to those who have made it their life\u2019s work. We certainly believe baking brings people together, brings joy, and can simply be a great source of comfort at any time, but more than ever in these incredibly challenging times. So we hope you\u2019re able to enjoy a freshly baked loaf of bread or the pure delight of a warm chocolate chip cookie. Stay hopeful. Remain resolute. Together, we\u2019ll move through this. Please continue to follow CDC guidelines for remaining safe and healthy. Below you will find important information about the critical ways we are working to address this crisis. Karen Colberg &amp; Ralph Carlton Co-CEOs, King Arthur Baking Company - Safety and Wellness Measures - Safety is our priority: your safety as well as that of our employee-owners. We\u2019ve built a strong network of protections around our team members, beginning with the best safeguard available \u2014 social distancing. This has taken the form of many of our team working from home and includes the rapid mobilization of new resources to make off-site work possible for many who would have previously been unequipped to do so. For those whose roles simply can\u2019t be translated away from our facilities, such as production and fulfillment, we\u2019ve rearranged work spaces and schedules to promote person-to-person distance. In addition to this, we\u2019ve enhanced our already robust cleanliness processes by: - Increasing sanitization frequency for our buildings and equipment - Providing more hand sanitizer stations in active areas - Reinforcing education on thorough hand washing and personal hygiene techniques - Wearing of cloth masks within our facilities and rubber gloves during product handling - Monitoring movement within our buildings to both prevent illness and enable us to take precise action should anyone become ill despite every precaution being taken We also recognize that there\u2019s more to protecting our team than just physical proximity and cleanliness. During this time of nationwide instability, security for one\u2019s livelihood is paramount. Our Leadership and Human Resources teams have assembled a portfolio of benefits and policies to help protect the jobs and income of King Arthur employee-owners. These solutions include: - Significantly extending the length of guaranteed paid time off - Extending new time off benefits to cover caring for dependents facing health or schedule disruptions, including children whose schools have closed or other reliant family - Cross-training those ready to work, but whose normal roles are paused, so that they can assist areas of our company facing greater levels of demand - Increasing access to telehealth resources for both physical and mental health Guidance from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and state health authorities have been, and will continue to be, our team\u2019s primary sources for information on safety and best practices as we face the challenges posed by Covid-19. We\u2019ll continue to use these recommendations as the framework of our decision making to ensure safety remains the priority in all our efforts. - Supporting our Community - For us, baking has always been about strengthening the bonds of community. There\u2019s no more fundamental example of people coming together than the timeless mainstay of a group circling around a warm fire, passing food from one to the other. In difficult times like these, our greatest supports are the people around us who care for each other and extend a hand when others need it most. In this effort, we\u2019ve launched a new aid program called For Goodness Bakes, a lighthearted name for an important initiative to keep bakeries running during financially challenging times. To do this, we\u2019re directing tens of thousands of dollars to directly purchase bread and other baked goods from King Arthur bakery customers, which they then distribute to areas of need within their local communities \u2014 food pantries, organizations that support unemployed food service workers, homeless populations, and more. Our employee-owners have also leapt to the task of addressing other needs in our own local community around Norwich, VT: - A sewing collective among us have put needle and thread to the task of making hundreds of cloth masks for health care workers, our own team members who continue to safely perform essential roles at our own facilities, and others in need - Putting our Caf\u00e9 Sous Chef on an extended volunteer assignment to manage daily takeout meals, organize food deliveries, and coordinate food drops for our local food shelf program - Donating thousands of fresh-baked breads and other baked goods to local food shelves and shelters We\u2019ve also directed more time and energy towards developing free educational resources in our social media channels. From our approachable and uplifting father + son baking series Martin Bakes at Home, to our instructional kid-focused Bake for Good videos, to our weekly Facebook Live Isolation Baking Show with accomplished bakers Jeffrey Hamelman and Gesine Bullock-Prado, along with running Q&amp;As, publishing new recipes, and increasing our blog posting frequency, we seek to provide for an especially urgent combination of needs: no-cost, quality baking education and recipes, and places where people can feed their yearning for community in a setting that\u2019s friendly, uplifting, and supportive. If you\u2019re on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter, we invite you to join in our community by asking questions and showing us what you\u2019re baking by tagging @kingarthurflour and using #bakewithus - Product Availability on our Website - You\u2019ve probably witnessed empty flour shelves at your grocery store and backordered items on our website. Demand for these products has sharply multiplied in past weeks, outpacing the speed at which new products can be created and delivered even as our mills run at full capacity and we\u2019ve added another mill to the King Arthur family. We\u2019re working closely with our mills and partners to support rapid production schedules within an environment of safety. We will continually evaluate all resources available to us and creatively pursue additional solutions as we seek to provide the best service possible while overcoming the challenges posed by Covid-19. - Order Shipping Times - Due to unprecedented levels of ordering through our website, maxed capacity among national carriers (including our shipper, FedEx), and more caution applied to all procedures in response to Covid-19, customers should be prepared for delays in receiving their orders. We\u2019ve temporarily introduced the following measures to help your order ship as quickly as possible:s - Suspended shipments to Canada and other international locations - Secured the services of an extra fulfillment partner to pack and ship orders - Added shifts in our warehouse to the extent that we\u2019re able to do so safely Know that our team is working diligently to provide you with the best experience we possibly can under the exceptional conditions we all find ourselves in. You can rely on us to continue finding creative solutions to challenging problems like these while prioritizing health and well-being. - Product Availability in Grocery Stores - By now, you\u2019ve probably witnessed empty flour shelves at your grocery store and backordered items on our website. Demand for these products has sharply multiplied in past weeks, outpacing the speed at which new product can be created and delivered even as our mills run at full capacity. In some cases, getting more product onto shelves has been delayed within stores themselves as many struggle with fewer staff, reduced hours, and other challenges related to Covid-19. Our supply chain and logistics team is actively working with stores and distributors across the country to get our flour back on the shelves of grocery stores and national retailers. To help address these challenges: - Our mills have extended their working hours by introducing additional shifts - We\u2019ve welcomed a new partner mill to the King Arthur production family - We\u2019ve shifted parts of our distribution network from rail to truck, quickening transit time You can rely on our team to continually evaluate all resources available to us and pursue additional solutions as we seek to provide the best service possible while overcoming the challenges posed by Covid-19. - Baking School and our Norwich Store &amp; Caf\u00e9 - In support of the health and well-being of our customers, community, and our team of employee-owners, we have made some adjustments at our Baking School and Caf\u00e9 &amp; Store. Find the most up-to-date information here. We thank you for your understanding and for working with us to pursue a safe, healthy environment for all. We plan to reintroduce normal operations and programs once we\u2019re confident this time of heightened risk has passed.

We partnered with organizations doing essential work to create food justice for BIPOC communities. We also expanded our network of content contributors to feature a broader range of voices, perspectives, backgrounds, and areas of expertise, prioritizing those historically excluded from the food media landscape. Justice, especially food and racial justice, will continue to be an essential pillar of our giving. We pushed forward on our commitment to greater corporate sustainability, completing a year-long sustainability assessment, evaluating the lifecycle of our products from farm to kitchen. This assessment became the framework of our 2030 sustainability goals, focused on social, environmental, and economic stewardship. While these goals won t be announced until 2022, sustainability and DEI is now embedded in our organization and work is underway. We believe that baking can make the world a better place \u2014 all while enjoying delicious treats along the way. Read on to learn more about the work we re doing to make this happen. Sincerely, Karen Colberg &amp; Ralph Carlton PEOPLE Employee Ownership King Arthur Baking is 100% employee-owned! Each person working here has a real stake in the company s success. - 100% Employee-Owned - 363 Employee Owners - Best for the World for Workers B Corp for 2021 Compensation We believe in paying a fair and competitive wage and sharing the company\u2019s success with each person. In 2019, we increased our entry wage to $15.00/hour: more than 37% greater than the minimum wage in our county. Profit sharing is paid out to all eligible employee-owners when the company achieves its financial targets. Wellness We are committed to fostering a culture of wellness and healthy lifestyles throughout the organization. - $500 in wellness incentives per employee - Tiered subsidy in local farm s CSA program - 4 hours of paid time off per year to vote Culture of Belonging We believe our culture is paramount to all that we do. In 2021, nurturing and evolving that culture became more important than ever. We worked to ensure King Arthur provides a workplace environment that prioritizes respect, inclusivity, and equal opportunity, and which better reflects the wonderful diversity of our baking community. - Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion team comprised of 14 employee-owners - 98% participation in cultural proficiency and social justice trainings - Transformation of hiring practices to recruit for culture add rather than culture fit - Named to Best Places to Work in Vermont since 2006 Volunteer Time All employee-owners receive 40 hours of paid volunteer time per year. |FY17||FY18||FY19||FY20||FY21| |Employees Participating||293||270||300||302||251| |Hours||5,635||5,151||6,126||6,116||3,452| 69% of employees volunteering in the community. * Volunteering decreased due to COVID COMMUNITY Giving 2021 |2017||2018||2019||2020||2021| |$313k||$325k||$316k||$778k||$711k| |-16%||+4%||-3%||146%||-9%| Our giving back philosophy is a cornerstone of our mission to use our business as a force for good and to build stronger and healthier communities. For Goodness Bakes We launched For Goodness Bakes, an initiative to help bakeries across the country during financially challenging times. We directed tens of thousands of dollars to purchase bread and baked goods from bakeries, which they then distributed to areas of need within their local communities. Equitable Access to Real Food Creating a more just food system is integral to realizing an inclusive, equitable future for all people. In 2021 we donated flour to 55 foodbanks in 34 states and were named a Feeding America Guiding Partner. Building Community Through Baking We run a national Bake for Good program: a free, STEM-based program that teaches kids how to bake bread and encourages them to donate a loaf. This program went virtual in 2021, providing a bright spot for many students and teachers during remote learning. Local Giving We have the privilege to help raise up our local communities through the support of partners such as Willing Hands, a food recovery organization which serves 30,000 individuals annually while mitigating 1 million pounds of CO2 emissions from food waste. Regenerative Food Systems We support efforts that positively impact our natural environment, conserve resources, and develop renewable energy sources, such as Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont s Resilience Grants for the BIPOC farming community. Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion We Are Taking A Stand At the beginning of the year, we created a fund to support organizations that address the inequities in our food systems and help our most marginalized communities gain equal access to food. We spent time listening and learning to understand how we can become better, more effective partners. We partnered with 18 organizations serving BIPOC communities to: - Increase access to farmland and agricultural resources - Break down barriers to food entrepreneurship - Increase access to healthy food This is only the beginning of our work to enhance equity and food justice. We will use our voice and uplift the voices of others to celebrate the diversity in baking. We will continue to work collectively with partner organizations, content contributors, consumers, and our fellow employee-owners to learn together and foster change. PLANET From farms to kitchens, we are on a mission to use the power of baking to restore nature and build a more equitable world. In 2021, we conducted a year-long sustainability assessment to evaluate the lifecycle of our products from farm to kitchen and identify our 2030 sustainability goals (to be announced in 2022). Sustainability Our definition of sustainability is holistic. King Arthur Baking nurtures people and the planet with: - An approach to business that balances purpose and profit - Protection and regeneration of natural resources - Responsible sourcing of ingredients and products - Greater equity for all people and communities Circular Packaging - 100% recyclable flour bags - SFI certified (mill partners) - Incorporating PCR into pack Renewable Energy - 500kW solar array in Norwich, VT that offsets over 50% of our total electricity use - Two EV Charging Stations at retail location - Purchased electricity 100% carbon free and 68% renewable Our emissions are dominated by the wheat supply chain (growing, milling, and transportation), not our headquarter offices and operations. And we take responsibility for all of it. Total Estimated Emissions Usage |Wheat &amp; Milling||59.1%| |Transportation||20.0%| |Packaging Life Cycle||3.0%| |Other Flours &amp; Ingredients||5.1%| |Use Phase - Product||12.5%| |HQ/Retail/Offices||0.4%| Regenerative Agriculture This work begins in the field, partnering with farmers to learn and encourage environmentally and socially responsible practices. We are working with mills and farmers to progress on the regenerative agriculture journey. In early 2021, we partnered with Ardent Mills, one of our long-time trusted milling partners, on a regenerative agriculture program to strengthen the soil ecosystem and help producers improve their farms  productivity and profitability. We are also actively seeing and engaging with other mill partners and farmers. $150k+ donated to nonprofits in fiscal year 2021 $981,245 amount donated since 2014 MEASURING PROGRESS B Impact Assessment: King Arthur Baking has been evaluating our social and environmental performance since 2007. |Summary||FY21 KAB Score||Median Score*||Change vs. FY20| |Governance||18.2||7.3||+0.2| |Workers||61||31.1||+0.2| |Community||18.6||13.5||-0.8| |Environment||24.2||16||+1.7| |Customers||3.2||1.9||-0.1| |Overall B Score||125.4||84.1||+1.2| * of all business that have completed the B Impact Assessment in the U.S. LOOKING AHEAD In FY2022, we aim to nurture Culture &amp; Community through the following goals: - Focus on DEI, specifically around equitable access and building a culture of belonging - Introduce new hybrid work model supported by new facilities plan - Develop talent to support future growth - Build and begin implementation of our sustainability strategy, including multiple regenerative agriculture initiatives As a Benefit Corporation, our directors and officers upheld and acted in accordance with Vermont standards.

Pizza Night, Perfected A 4-step plan to finding the pizza that ll work for you every week. Pizza is not a special-occasion food \u2014 it\u2019s an every occasion food. Because pizza is flexible: It\u2019s endlessly adaptable, ready to make use of whatever odds and ends are in the fridge. And despite what you may think, it\u2019s an easy dinner that can bend to any schedule \u2014 you just have to find the pizza recipe that works for you. So here\u2019s a four-point plan for designing the perfect pizza night, the one you can repeat week after week after week. It all starts with finding the pizza dough that fits your lifestyle. Once you have it, all that\u2019s left to do is to throw on some toppings, turn your oven to pizza mode (much easier than it sounds), and repeat the process a week later. Or sooner! After all, there\u2019s no wrong time to make pizza. The only way to go wrong is when you don\u2019t make pizza often enough. Pizza night in 4 steps Find your pizza The most important step in designing pizza night is picking the pie. It has to be the crust you crave (blistered Neapolitan? Thick, soft Detroit-style?), but it also has to fit your schedule. Some doughs require overnight rises, while others barely need to rise at all. Which recipe works for you depends on if you\u2019re the type of person who wants to mix a dough the night before, in the morning \u2014 or an hour before you want to eat. The Mood: Traditional and ready in 24 hours The Pick: Neapolitan-Style Pizzaget the recipe The Mood: Gluten-free in about an hour The Pick: Gluten-Free PizzaGet the recipe The Mood: Pan pizza you can plan ahead for The Pick: Crispy Cheesy Pan Pizzaget the recipe The Mood: Crispy, crackery, and fast The Pick: Thin-Crust PizzaGet the recipe The Mood: Thick, soft, and same-day The Pick: Detroit-Style Pizzaget the recipe The Mood: Delivery-style (and almost as quick) The Pick: The Easiest Pizza You ll Ever MakeGet the recipe Step Two Pick your toppings Tomato sauce and mozzarella are the obvious choices, and they re the defaults for a reason. But when you do pizza night every week, it pays to have options to rotate in and out: muenster instead of mozz, romesco in place of tomato. Make your oven a pizza oven The average home oven tops out at 550\u02daF \u2014 a far cry from the 900\u02daF ovens that Neapolitan pies are traditionally baked in. But fabulous pizza can nevertheless be made in a home oven. All it takes is a hot broiler, a few pieces of equipment \u2014 and maybe a quick physics lesson. Wait, you have an Ooni? That\u2019s a different story. Ooni tabletop pizza ovens can get as hot as 900\u02daF, turning out pizzas in 90 seconds. But according to King Arthur baker Martin Philip, you may want to actually turn them down to 750\u02daF. That\u2019s just one of a plethora of tips Martin has for mastering these machines. Pizza Stone You can make your pizza on a sheet pan, but switching to a pizza stone is a major upgrade in terms of thermal mass. Leave the stone in the oven while it preheats and it ll do wonders to give your pizza a crisp bottom crust. Pizza Steel Like a pizza stone, but even better: Being a metal, steel is far more conductive than ceramic, which means that not only do steels hold heat well, but they also transfer it to the pizza more quickly than stones. Ooni Koda Pizza Oven This incredible portable oven can heat up to 900\u00b0F and cook a pizza in 90 seconds. But that s just the beginning. Once you get a handle on it, you ll use the Ooni to bake fish, make tortillas, and roast fruit for dessert.
